## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Chapter 1. Introduction 

```{r}
# predictive modeling: the process of developing a mathematical tool or model that generates an accurate prediction 
```

## 1.1 Prediction versus interpretation
```{r}
# There is a trade-off between the prediction accuracy and causality interpretation 
```

## 1.2 Key ingredients of predictive models 
```{r}
# Intuition and deep knowledge of the problem context + relevant data + versatile computational toolbox 
```
