# Applied-Predictive-Modeling

Max Kuhn, Kjell Johnson

This is a book on data analysis with a specific focus on the practice of predictive modeling. The term predictive modeling may stir associations such
as machine learning, pattern recognition, and data mining. Indeed, these associations are appropriate and the methods implied by these terms are an
integral piece of the predictive modeling process. But predictive modeling encompasses much more than the tools and techniques for uncovering patterns
within data. The practice of predictive modeling defines the process of developing a model in a way that we can understand and quantify the modelâ€™s
prediction accuracy on future, yet-to-be-seen data. The entire process is the focus of this book.
